# FE Customizer Engine
This project is a modern rewrite of the original [KamuiCustomizer](https://luminescentblade.github.io/KamuiCustomizer) with the intention of 
- reusable customizer code
- extending for options beyond the canon standard
- finally adding Kris

## Done so far: 
- reimplemented all existing KamuiCustomizer features
- support Lazy Loading
## To do list:
- add Customizer Home Page
- export npm package
- port RobinCustomizer
- add extended options for Corrin
  - skintone
  - eyecolor
  - full color picker hair color
- add the same support for Robin
- look into similar support for Kris (very different art style, may not work)
